## Juhoflix

This web page is OTT video service web page like Netflix. We developed the web page using next.js, React, and TypeScript, and saved the user's user information and data such as the genre of the video, id, duration, etc. in JSON format using Prisma and Mongo db.

Because of the OAuth function, users can log in with Google or Github accounts and log in by signing up for membership.
Appropriate codes were used in mobile environments. Users can also save their favorite videos on their favorite cards.
